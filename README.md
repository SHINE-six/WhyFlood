## Project Overview
Floods, one of nature's most devastating forces, unleash chaos on communities worldwide. It contaminates our water sources, spreads diseases, and disrupts the delicate balance of ecosystems. In the last 10 years floods affected 426.84 millions of people, claiming 56000 lives. Its damages also inflict long-lasting economic hardships which cost total of 431.48 billion USD worldwide. From the recent incident in North Chungcheong, South Korea 47 people died from floods and 14400 affected byit.. Even our world-class, New York City also can't avoid flooding on On September 29, 2023, flood came and damaged the city costing around $100 million lost and disrupted subway system and the entire New York City Subway system. 

This project is a flood simulation and management system using digital twins, AI and Computer Aided Design (CAD), creating a digital model that mirrors the city's infrastructure and natural landscapes in real-time. By leveraging AI, the system can predict flood events with high accuracy, allowing for preemptive actions to protect infrastructure, reduce economic losses, and safeguard lives. This significantly improves the city's ability to respond to flood events efficiently and minimizes the impact on the urban environment.

It is name, Spongey, for that it abstractically absorb water from the city, preventing flood and damage

## User Manual

### Start of a new project
![New Project Setup](assetForReadME//1First.png)

As the picture shown, when starting a new project, the user will be prompted to enter the location of the building site. The user can enter the location by entering the latitude and longitude of the location or by clicking on the map.

#Google Maps Platform

### Building digital twin model
![Building Digital Twin Model](assetForReadME//2Second.png)

So after the user has entered the location of the building site, the flat working site scene will be render with the terrain landscape of the location, mimicking the landscape of the location, particularly the unbalanced height. #Google Earth Engine  

The Urban Planner will then be able to import either their prepare 3D model of the cities built from other 3D modelling software, and when import to the scene, it can simulate to them whether the cities scene is suitable for the location or not. As a not suitable cities 3D model and location, will cause much overlap of the landscape to the cities scene model.

Alternatively, they can build the cities scene one by one
![Building Digital Twin Model](assetForReadME//3Three.png)

As seen in the picture above, Spongey provide the urban planner with option of placing placeholder shape that may represent the building overall dimension, this help in quick building of the cities scene into a digital twin. Beside just box for building, there can traingular prism, circle decoration or cities, flat rectangular road, and many more.

![Building Digital Twin Model](assetForReadME//4forth.png)

After placing of their placeholder shape, the user can import 3D model of the building to replace the placeholder shape, and the user can also import the texture of the building to the 3D model, to make it look more realistic. And user can appoint each of this building to be in what type of business, such as manufacturing, subway system, shopping mall, residential house, just to name a few, this allow Spongey smart AI to understand the building and the cities scene better, which can automatically appoint each of these building to a level scale of priority in term of flood-vulnerable from 1 - 10, for instance a subway system will have a flood-vulnerable building prioirity scale of 10; Spongey then can provide better suggestion to the user.

![Building Digital Twin Model](assetForReadME//5fifth.png)

The overall will look like this example, where the user has built the cities scene with the 3D model of the building and the texture of the building.

#### Acknolwedgement of complement software
The 3D model of the building or cities are not created by Spongey, but rather imported from other 3D modelling software, such as Blender, SketchUp, AutoCAD, and many more.

### Drainage System Design
![Drainage System Design](assetForReadME//6sixth.png)

So onto the building of the drainage system, starting from the right panel, user can assess the current estimate cost of the drainage system, maximum outflow rate of this drainage system (meaning the amount of water that are flowing out of the drainage system into the outer environment, such as river, or sea). The user can also assess the maximum inflow rate of the drainage system (meaning the amount of water that are flowing into the drainage system from the city environment, mostly from the sewer inlet). Not only that, the data of volumn of water that can be stored in the drainage system can also be assessed.

Onto the left panel, the user can place the drainage system into the cities scene, and the user can also place the sewer inlet into the cities scene. The user can also place the river or sea into the cities scene, and the user can also place the rain into the cities scene. In this process, the trained city drainage system expert AI by Spongey, will provide suggestion to the user with the best location to place the drainage system, sewer inlet, river or sea, and type of drainage components, to ensure the drainage system is working at its best. The user interface of this should be user-friendly, such of the drag and drop of the 3D drianage model into the cities scene, and Spongey app will automatically understand how the drainage system will combine, such as the outlet of the pipe tot he inlet of the sewer drain.

The import button allow user to import 3D model of the drainage system and sewer inlet from complementing software, that is specifically for designing the shape, material, size, of the drainage system and sewer inlet. One example such as this article technology, [https://trenchlesstechnology.com/now-showing-in-3d-the-sewer-systems-under-our-feet/](https://trenchlesstechnology.com/now-showing-in-3d-the-sewer-systems-under-our-feet/)

At the left panel, there is also one feature of "Generate detail layout plan", which is something for the real urban planner to use, where Spongey will generate the detail layout plan of the drainage system, sewer inlet, and river or sea, and the user can print this layout plan to be used in the real world.

Example of this detail layout plan will look like as follows:

### Simulation of Flood and Rain

![Simulation of Flood and Rain](assetForReadME//7seventh.png)

During the simulation, focus on the left panel first, the user can simulate the flood and rain, and also third option simulate from past data, this is with the help of Google Earth Engine, Spongey will collect the past weather data of the location specifically, the past data of the location in term of the rain history, and flood history. So with the simulation of rain, there can be a scale from 1 to 7, to simulate the different level of rain, and the user can also simulate the flood, with the scale from 1 to 5, to simulate the different level of flood. The user can also simulate from the past data, for an extend of month range from 1 to 36 months, which with the help of machine learning, will try to simulate in the upcoming n-th months of this city developed, what type of rain and flood will this city face, and how well does this city handle the rain and flood.

#### Building Assessment
Going to the right panel, user can assess the overall building damage real-time with the simulation ongoing, and AI of Spongey can estimate the cost of damage based on the building type, and also the damage it receive. Also because of the AI knowing the building type, Spongey can show the population distribution in the form of a red scale mask on top of the city model, which estimate where most of the people in the city will be located at, and the user can also assess the population damage real-time with the simulation ongoing, and AI of Spongey can estimate the cost of damage based on the population distribution, and also the damage it receive.

As the picture above shown, individual building can also be selected for isolating assess, and their building damage receive can be abstractically show as a 3D board on top of the building.

#### Drainage System Assessment

![Drainage System Assessment](assetForReadME//8eighth.png)

Going to the right panel, user can assess the overall drainage system performance such as monitoring the water intake of each the drain inlet 
![Drainage System Assessment](assetForReadME//10tenth.png)
And the water level in the drain sewer as the simulation ongoing, supplying real-time data to Spongey dashboard.
![Drainage System Assessment](assetForReadME//11eleventh.png)

Then based on all the performance analyse, the Spongey drainage system expert AI will come into play again, suggesting for enhancement to the current city drainage system, enhancement can be of followoing:
- Increase the size of the drainage system
- Increase the size of the sewer inlet
- New inlet of the sewer drain
- New outlet of the sewer drain
- Adjusting the location of the drainage system
- Adjusting the location of the sewer inlet
- Angle of inlet pipe
- and many more

The example of suggesting new inlet from the AI after assessing perhaps, the flash-flood is reaching and damaging the high flood-vulnerable priority building (like subway station).
